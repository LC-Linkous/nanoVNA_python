# Contributing to nanoVNA_python

Thanks for your interest in improving nanoVNA_python (`nvnapython` on PyPI). This
is an **unofficial** community library. It is not endorsed by the official
NanoVNA product or company, and nothing here should be read as an authoritative
statement about device behavior — always defer to the
[official NanoVNA documentation](https://tinysa.org/wiki/).

This project drives real hardware over serial. Improper usage may **destroy your device** — please read the safety notes in the README before contributing
anything that changes what gets sent to the device, especially around output /
signal-generator commands.

## Ways to contribute

- **Report a bug** — open an issue with the bug template. Include your OS,
  Python version, device model (Basic / Ultra / Ultra+), and the firmware
  version (from `info()`).
- **Request a feature** — open an issue with the feature template. Note that
  GUI features are out of scope; this is deliberately a non-GUI API.
- **Improve docs** — README fixes, clearer examples, and beginner notes are all
  welcome and don't require hardware.
- **Submit code** — see the workflow below.

## Development setup

The installable project lives in the `nvnapython/` subdirectory (the one with
`pyproject.toml`). This project uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) with a
committed `uv.lock`.

```bash
cd nvnapython
uv sync                 # pyserial + numpy + dev group, editable install of nvnapython
uv run pytest           # hardware tests self-skip without a device
```

Run everything through `uv run` so the synced environment is used. A bare
`python ...` can silently create or use a second environment.

## Before you open a pull request

Run these from the `nvnapython/` directory:

```bash
uv run pytest -m "not hardware"     # full hardware-free suite must pass
uv run ruff check .                 # lint (blocking ruleset: E9 + F + W)
uv run mypy                         # type check (blocking; the package ships py.typed)
```

CI runs the same suite across Windows, Linux, and macOS on Python 3.10–3.13,
plus the lint + type checks and a package build check. The mypy gate currently
runs at basic strictness (it passes today); the full-annotation pass that
makes the `py.typed` promise true — and upgrades the gate to
`disallow_untyped_defs`, as tsapython did — is a planned, separate project.

Also expected with a code PR:

- **A CHANGELOG entry** under `[Unreleased]` — say what changed and why.
- **Coverage** — CI gates at 85% (`--cov-fail-under=85`); new code arrives
  with its tests.
- **Hardware evidence for core changes** — any change under `src/nvnapython/`
  should include evidence of a run against a real NanoVNA (hardware tests
  passing); paste the pytest tail in the PR. Docs, examples, and test-only
  changes are exempt. CI cannot attach a device, so this half of the gate is
  enforced by review.

## Test coverage and platform policy

CI gates coverage at **85% minimum** (`--cov-fail-under=85`) on every leg of
the matrix. Coverage below the gate fails the build; new code arrives with
the tests that keep it above.

**Supported platforms are the ones verified against a real NanoVNA** —
currently Windows (primary). A platform is promoted when the full suite,
hardware tests included, passes there with a real device, and is then held
to the same standards.

## Adding a command

The `NanoVNA` class is composed from mixins in `src/nvnapython/_commands/`, wired
together in `core.py`. The class talks to the device only through `self.ser`
(a pyserial `Serial`) and the single method `NanoVNA_serial()` — the two seams
the test fixtures exploit. To add a command:

1. Add the method to the appropriate mixin (`acquisition.py`, `calibration.py`,
   `display_ui.py`, `levels_gain.py`, `markers_traces.py`, `output_signal.py`,
   `presets_config.py`, or `system_info.py`).
2. Route the device write through `NanoVNA_serial()` — don't touch `self.ser`
   directly from a command method.
3. Add a **command-construction test** in the matching `tests/test_*.py` file:
   use the `recorder` fixture to assert the exact command string the method
   builds (e.g. `"rbw 100\r\n"`) on the happy path, and assert that **nothing
   is sent** on the validation-error path.
4. If the command's *response* needs parsing, add a parsing test using the
   `fake_port` fixture against canned bytes — ideally frozen from real
   hardware via `tests/collect_samples.py` rather than hand-written.
5. Follow the existing input-validation pattern (accepted-values checks with
   `verbose` / `error_byte` behavior) so error handling stays consistent.

## Tests that touch hardware

Tests that need a real device are marked `@pytest.mark.hardware` and self-skip
when no NanoVNA is detected. Captured-response fixtures live in
`tests/fixtures/` and are frozen from real device output via
`tests/collect_samples.py` (read-only commands only). If you add a parser, add
a captured fixture rather than a hand-written one where possible, and note
which device model and firmware produced it.

## Commit and PR conventions

- Keep PRs focused; one logical change per PR is easiest to review.
- Reference the issue the PR closes (`Closes #123`).
- Describe what you tested, and whether it was tested against a real device
  (which model and firmware) or the mocked fixtures only.
- New public methods need a README entry in the command reference and, ideally,
  a runnable example under `examples/`.
